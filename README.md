This code is derived from the Adafruit code at https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF8001/

However the Nordic BLE SDK has been replaced with the latest available from https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/ble-sdk-arduino/releases

The nRFgo Studio generated XML file is the one from the Adafruit repository.

However the .h files etc. were regenerated using the latest version nRFgo Studio. See uart/README.md for more details.
