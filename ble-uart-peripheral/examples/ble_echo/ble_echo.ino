// These includes are not required by the C or C++ preprocessor.
// They are required only as pointers for the Arduino IDE as to which libraries are required.

// The real code for this example is in the corresponding .cpp file, which
// should be open in the editor tab next to this one if using the Arduino IDE.

// If using Eclipse or another IDE then this file can be ignored and the librares
// should be included via whatever mechanism is appropriate for that IDE.
